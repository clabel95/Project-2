Remove from the heat and let cool while, in a separate bowl, you beat the eggs until creamy. When the boiled syrup has cooled, beat in the eggs, salt and pecans. Pour into the unbaked pie shell and bake for about 50 minutes. Notes:A little cream (about 1\/4 to 1\/2 cup) mixed into a pecan pie filling before baking gives it a richer, lighter texture. For a sweeter, lighter pie: add more sugar and use fewer pecans; for a denser, less sweet pie: add more pecans and use less sugar. The buttery flavour and the lard-induced flakiness of a butter and lard crust make it the perfect one for a perfect pecan pie. And a Southern pecan pie authority I know suggests that you roll out the dough a little thicker than usual; a thick, richly shortened crust provides an appetizing balance to the sweetness of the filling.",

In a small bowl, lightly whisk the egg yolks, then whisk in the milk, 2 tablespoons of melted butter and lemon juice. Add the yolk mixture to the flour mixture and, using a wooden spoon, stir until well blended. The batter will be lumpy. In a clean bowl, using an electric mixer on high speed, beat the egg whites until stiff, but not dry, peaks form. Using a silicone spatula, fold about one-third of the egg whites into the batter to lighten it, then fold in the rest just until no white streaks remain. Stir in fresh dill. Brush the wells of the ebelskiver pan with some of the remaining melted butter and place over medium heat. When the butter starts to bubble, add about 1 tablespoon batter to each well. Working quickly, carefully spoon about 1\/2 teaspoon of the smoked salmon into the center of each pancake, then spoon about 1\/2 teaspoon of the cream cheese on top. Top each with another 1 tablespoon batter. (Alternatively, gently mix the cream cheese and salmon together. Spoon about 1 teaspoon into the center of each pancake) Cook until the bottoms of the pancakes are lightly browned and crisp, 3-5 minutes. Use 2 short wooden skewers to turn all the  pancakes and cook until lightly browned on the second side, about 3 minutes longer. Transfer the finished pancakes to a platter and keep warm  in the oven while you repeat to make 2 more batches. Serve right away.",

Spoon meringue into pan lightly, building up the edges to come at least 1\/2 inch above the side of the pan. Bake in preheated 300 degree oven for 35 to 40 minutes until light brown. Cool completely before adding filling. TO MAKE FILLING: Melt chocolate and water in a pan over hot, but not boiling, water, stirring occasionally, to blend. Add vanilla and chocolate mixture (cooled) to whipped cream and pile into meringue shell, swirling top with spatula. Be sure to cool the chocolate mixture before adding to the whipped cream. If it is too warm, the mixture will thin out. If this happens, chill until it is thick enough to put in shell.",

Season the beef liberally with salt and pepper and sear, in batches, until nicely browned on both sides. Once the meat is browned, add the first batch of meat back to the pan along with the onions, carrots and bacon. Sprinkle in the flour and stir. Cook for 1 minute before deglazing the pan with the beer. Add the remaining ingredients and bring the mixture to a simmer. Cover the pot and put it in the oven to braise until the beef is tender, about 2 hours. Remove the pot from the oven and transfer the pot roast to a serving dish.",
