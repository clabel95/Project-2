Pour into the unbaked pie shell and bake for about 50 minutes. Notes:A little cream (about 1\/4 to 1\/2 cup) mixed into a pecan pie filling before baking gives it a richer, lighter texture. For a sweeter, lighter pie: add more sugar and use fewer pecans; for a denser, less sweet pie: add more pecans and use less sugar. The buttery flavour and the lard-induced flakiness of a butter and lard crust make it the perfect one for a perfect pecan pie. And a Southern pecan pie authority I know suggests that you roll out the dough a little thicker than usual; a thick, richly shortened crust provides an appetizing balance to the sweetness of the filling.",

Using a silicone spatula, fold about one-third of the egg whites into the batter to lighten it, then fold in the rest just until no white streaks remain. Stir in fresh dill. Brush the wells of the ebelskiver pan with some of the remaining melted butter and place over medium heat. When the butter starts to bubble, add about 1 tablespoon batter to each well. Working quickly, carefully spoon about 1\/2 teaspoon of the smoked salmon into the center of each pancake, then spoon about 1\/2 teaspoon of the cream cheese on top. Top each with another 1 tablespoon batter. (Alternatively, gently mix the cream cheese and salmon together. Spoon about 1 teaspoon into the center of each pancake) Cook until the bottoms of the pancakes are lightly browned and crisp, 3-5 minutes. Use 2 short wooden skewers to turn all the  pancakes and cook until lightly browned on the second side, about 3 minutes longer.

In a medium saucepan, whisk together granulated sugar, lemon zest and juice, egg yolks, and salt over medium-high. Cook, whisking constantly, until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon and small bubbles form around edge of pan, about 5 minutes (do not boil). Immediately remove from heat while continuing to whisk. Pour through a fine-mesh sieve into a heatproof bowl, pressing on lemon curd with a rubber spatula. Place plastic wrap directly against surface of curd and refrigerate until cool, about 30 minutes (or up to overnight). In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat egg whites on high until stiff peaks form, 2 minutes. Gently fold egg whites into cooled lemon curd. In the same large bowl, beat cream on high until stiff peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes. Gently fold whipped cream into lemon curd mixture. Pour into mold and freeze until firm, 6 hours (or up to overnight). To serve, remove parchment, top with raspberries and dust with confectioners' sugar.",
